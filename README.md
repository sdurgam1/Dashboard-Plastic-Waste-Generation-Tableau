# Dashboard-Plastic-Waste-Generation-Tableau
<b>Abstract: </b>
Our motivation comes from the present world's burning situation, Environmental pollution caused due to usage of plastic that has rendered our way of life unsustainable. So, we have analyzed the Plastic Waste dataset that contains information about the Plastic Waste generated by different Countries across the world in the years 2010 and 2025. Using this data we want the reader to compare correlations, find the dependencies and summarize trends of Plastic waste generated and also, be able to present distributions to other users to get a better comprehension of the world and the detrimental effects of plastic on the nature due to the release of harmful gasses into the atmosphere.We want the user to know the distribution of plastic waste generated from each region, compare mismanagement by different countries through two different years 2010 and 2025, and understand contribution of plastic waste in different forms to the total plastic waste generated by all the countries around the world. Our main target would be governmental, not-for-profit, and public users who could leverage this information and aim up the efforts in an effective manner to save the environment. In the previous research the authors have emphasized more on the inadequately managed plastic waste and GDP per capita of that country which we think would be difficult for the users to understand and also they have used bar chart to visually represent this data for each country which makes it difficult to get the overview and adds cognitive load on the users when they have to compare between two different countries, so to address this issue we have implemented the overview by making use of Map plot which takes geospatial data to represent it in a way easier for the users to understand. We were able to validate the results that we achieved by using peer reviews , consulted the expert opinion and by conducting a survey for effectiveness of visualizations for the specific user tasks.

<b>1	INTRODUCTION: </b>
<p>Our Project domain defines one of the Environmental issues that is plastic waste generated all over the world. The users of our visualizations would be the governmental, not-for-profit and public users who can consume it to make efforts to save the environment. We want these users to perform certain sets of {action, target} pairs for every user task on our plastic waste dataset. Those are as follows, User Task 1: the users should be able to {present, distribution} summary of the amount of plastic waste generated by different countries around the world. User Task 2: the user should be able to {Summarize, Trends} of mismanaged plastic waste by each country in the years 2010 and 2025. User Task 3: users should be able to {present, distribution} Contribution of different forms Plastic Waste to Total Plastic Waste generated by different countries across the world. Most of previous research done using this dataset only talks about the GDP per capita and the inadequately managed plastic waste but we would like the users to analyze the amount of plastic that is generated by each country and the trends of how the mismanagement would be from 2010 to 2025 and get the general idea of whether there is an increase or a decrease in the amount of plastic waste that is generated and mismanaged, this could really help the users to reduce the amount of plastic generation that would in-turn decrease the mismanagement of plastic and helps in saving the Environmental health.
Our dataset, [1] Plastic waste data is in tabular format with 
192 items and 14 attributes that provide useful information regarding Mismanaged plastic waste in 2010 and  2025 in metric tons, waste generated, plastic waste generated in kg/day and also gives useful information about plastic waste generated from different forms. Using this we can answer some crucial question such as “Amount of plastic waste generated in one country to another ”, “How much amount of plastic waste was mismanaged in the years 2010 and 2025 (projected) by different countries across the world” and “What is the Contribution of different forms Plastic Waste to Total Plastic Waste generated”. These datasets are generally collected using various sources such as World Bank estimates, U.S national litter study and also some of the data is generated or calculated using the models for that specific project. In our dataset the column names Waste generation, Plastic waste generation, Inadequately managed plastic waste,Plastic waste littered, Mismanaged plastic waste, Mismanaged plastic waste in 2010, Mismanaged plastic waste in 2025 are calculated fields. There are certain limitation to this dataset, it does not clearly give the information of each of the fields that are part of the dataset and also while creating visualization for  user task 3 we faced an issue in Tableau [2] while using this dataset as it does not provide the associative relationship between the different fields of our dataset this made it difficult to generate part to whole contribution pie chart since Tableau was unable to find the relation between the fields to find the part to whole contribution. To overcome this we have transposed the data by changing the dataset rows to columns and this has created an associative relationship between the fields using the country field and we were able to generate the visualization for our user task 3. To implement all our visualization we have used Tableau Public which is a free version that is available to download and use. We have mainly used 3 idioms: Map plot, Bar plot and Pie chart for our user tasks. For our user task 2 we have added interactivity to our Map plot that could help users to select and filter the countries of their interest and compare between them for the 3 user tasks that we have created. This interactivity addresses the issues of having cognitive load on users of remembering the values on the plot that does not fully fit in the screen and requires the users to scroll to find and compare the different countries of interest, which the previous research studies were not able to provide to the users. We have also compared and contrasted between different idioms that we used to represent the same user task and its effectiveness. Overall we want to help the user to understand the growth in plastic waste and understand the importance of reducing the plastic waste generation to help save the Environment.

<b>User Task 1 :</b>
<p>For the user task one of providing the summary of the amount of plastic waste generated by different countries across the world,  the {action , target} pair would be that the user will be able to {present , distribution} of plastic waste generated by different countries. There were a couple of options we came up with to provide the summary view using the idioms such as Bar Plot, Heat Map and Map Plot. Each of these has a drawback that helped us make a decision on finalizing a visualization to represent our user task one.
</p>
<b>Option 1: Bar Plot</b>

![alt text](https://github.com/sdurgam1/Dashboard-Plastic-Waste-Generation-Tableau/blob/main/paper_source/figures/fig-5.png)
Fig. 5. Amount of Plastic Waste generated by each Country. Based on Plastic Waste data available, each bar in the Bar Plot represents a Country and the length of each bar represents the amount of Plastic Waste produced in tons by that country. Out of all countries, the United States is the highest producer of plastic waste based on the available data.

We have created a Bar Plot as shown in Fig. 5. to present the summary distribution of plastic waste generated by each country using the line as marks to represent the amount of plastic waste generated. Using this bar plot, users can easily find the highest and the lowest amount of plastic waste producing country by looking at the height of the bar but since it does not fit all the information on the screen and requires the users to scroll to find a country they are looking for can be a tedious job, so we have left out this option.

Option 2: Tree Map

![alt text](https://github.com/sdurgam1/Dashboard-Plastic-Waste-Generation-Tableau/blob/main/paper_source/figures/fig-6.png)
Fig. 6. Amount of Plastic Waste generated by each Country. Based on Plastic Waste data available, the size of each rectangle represents the waste generated by that Country and the color represents the quantity of Plastic Waste generated. The United States takes the top place with the dark blue color based on its per day Plastic Waste generation.

We have created a Tree map as shown in Fig. 6. as our second choice to represent the overview, and it could help the users to easily identify the country producing the highest and lowest and also it is ordered from maximum to minimum. The amount of plastic waste generated is represented with the mark as area of the box. The downside of using treemap is that the lowest producing Country’s name is not clearly visible due to less available area and it becomes difficult to understand when there are too many countries to display.

Option 3: Map Plot
![alt text](https://github.com/sdurgam1/Dashboard-Plastic-Waste-Generation-Tableau/blob/main/paper_source/figures/fig-7.png)
Fig. 7. Amount of Plastic Waste generated by each Country. Based on Plastic Waste data available, the geospatial map summarizes the total amount of Plastic Waste generated by each Country across the map. The amount of Plastic Waste produced and the name of the Country is represented as a label of that Country. 

As the third option we have created a Map Plot as shown in Fig. 7. It displays the amount of plastic waste generated by each country. Since the target users already have the knowledge about the geographical locations, they can easily identify the country on the Map plot. Also, this plot fits in the screen perfectly and does not require the users to scroll to find a country they are looking for.
User Task 2
For the user task two of providing the amount of  plastic waste that is mismanaged by each country across the world in 2010 and 2025 (Predicted data in dataset) has an {action, target} pair as {Summarize, Trends}. The users will be able to summarize the trends of mismanaged plastic waste by each country in the years 2010 and 2025. For this user task we came up with idioms that could help us achieve the user task and we finalized the idiom that suits the best by comparing the traits of each of the visualizations.

Option 1: Line Plot
We created a Line Plot as shown in Fig. 8. that shows the trends of variations in plastic waste produced in 2010 vs 2025 between different countries but these line marks do not clearly represent data for this user task we chose  and also it doesn't fit in the screen well. It requires the users to zoom in and place the cursor on a specific line to see the quantity of plastic waste produced and the name of that country. So we proceeded to make the second option of Paired Bar Plot for the same user task.

Fig. 8. Mismanaged Plastic Waste in 2010 vs 2025. Based on Plastic Waste data available, the line plot shows Plastic Waste produced by different countries in 2010 and 2025.

Option 2: Paired Bar Plot
![alt text](https://github.com/sdurgam1/Dashboard-Plastic-Waste-Generation-Tableau/blob/main/paper_source/figures/fig-9.png)
Fig. 9. Mismanaged Plastic Waste in 2010 vs 2025. Based on Plastic Waste data available, the Bar plot shows Plastic Waste produced by different countries in 2010 and 2025.

We created a Paired Bar Plot as shown in Fig. 9. that shows the paired bar plot for the amount of plastic waste that is mismanaged by different countries that was produced in two different years 2010 and 2025 (predicted amount given in dataset) by each country. Using this plot the user can easily see whether the value of plastic waste generated is increasing or decreasing from 2010 to 2025 within the same country and also be able to see the  relative increase or decrease with respect to other countries. The bar plot is represented on logarithmic scale along the y-axis for handling display of small values in mismanaged plastic waste, when compared to linear scale that could hardly be able to represent these values due to pixel ratio being too high to fit in display.

User Task 3
For the user task three of providing the Contribution of different plastic waste to total plastic waste generation, has an {action, target} pair of {present, distribution} and the users will be able to see the contribution of plastic waste in different forms to the total plastic waste generated by different countries across the world. Our design choice was a Donut Chart to represent the data for this user task.

Design Choice: Donut Chart

![alt text](https://github.com/sdurgam1/Dashboard-Plastic-Waste-Generation-Tableau/blob/main/paper_source/figures/fig-10.png)
Fig. 10. Contribution of Different Plastic Waste to Total Plastic Waste Generation. Based on Plastic Waste data available, the donut chart shows Plastic Waste in different forms contributing to the Total Plastic Waste generated by aggregating values from all the countries around the world. The area of the donut chart represents the amount of plastic waste contributed by each group. Here, the color Peach represents the contribution from Inadequately Mismanaged Plastic Waste, Turquoise represents the contribution from Plastic in the waste stream, Gold represents the contribution from Mismanaged Plastic waste and Purple represents the contribution from Plastic waste littered. Mismanaged Plastic waste contributes a total amount of 55.80% of overall Plastic waste generation. The percentage contribution of Plastic Waste littered is not clearly visible on the donut chart, it represents 2% of total area of contribution.

Fig. 10. shows donut charts which gives the percentage contribution of plastic waste in different forms to the total plastic waste generated by all the countries around the world. It clearly shows 4 categories: Inadequately managed plastic waste represented in Peach color, Mismanaged Plastic waste in Gold color, Plastic in waste stream in Turquoise color and Plastic waste littered in Purple color. Using this users can clearly see the contribution of different forms of plastic waste to the total plastic waste generated very easily.

To create this donut chart we have transformed our dataset to make a new subset of our dataset by transposing rows to columns. Tableau does not provide an option to create a donut chart directly but we can create a pie chart and then using dual axis we can create a donut chart. Tableau provides an option to create a pie chart of the different categories that have some common relationship that exists between the columns of the dataset and since we did not have fields that specify the relationship between the columns, we could not generate pie charts in Tableau. To resolve this issue we have transposed our data by changing rows to columns and this established the relation between the different categories of plastic waste generated and we were able to generate the pie chart and then we converted it to donut chart using dual axis.

Fig. 11. (a) Creating a group in Tableau. (b) Adding Countries to groups in Tableau

To simplify the search and filtering for the users we have added continental hierarchy into the data. Using this filter, users can check the plastic waste summary for a selected continent and its countries. We have achieved this by creating a grouping of countries in Tableau, to do this go to the Country column in the Tables section in tableau and select Create a group by right clicking on the country column as shown in Fig. 11 (a) . Once the pop up opens, select multiple countries using ctrl and left click and then click on Group to create a grouping of countries as shown in the Fig 11 (b). Once the grouping information is created we can drag and drop it into filters so as to create filtering based on continent information.

Fig. 12. Calculated field in Tableau

We have also created custom binning of data using the Tableau Calculated fields as shown in Fig. 12. to handle the outliers in the data and represent all the data accurately. Without the custom binning the ranges of bins generated by auto bin in Tableau does not give the user accurate information as the majority of the countries with lower plastic waste generation fall into the same bin.

Fig. 13.  Complete Dashboard (a) Original view (b) After filtering the data based on the countries selected.

We have also implemented item filtering which would remove the items that are not of interest to the user, this can help the users to compare specific countries of their choice by selecting and clicking on the countries using the mouse when the control key is pressed on the keyboard that allows multi selection. When the users select multiple countries on the Map plot as shown in Fig. 13.(b) the donut chart now shows only the aggregated contribution of different forms of plastic waste to total plastic waste generated by the countries selected and the bar plot shows only the information for these countries and the rest of the data is eliminated from the view. If the user clicks on the empty space on the Map plot this would deselect the selected countries and the view goes back to the original view as shown in Fig 13.(a). Users can also click a single country of their choice to  view the information related to only that specific country. When the user selects multiple countries on the Map plot, the donut chart changes the information from aggregated view to the country specific view that is instead of showing the aggregated data of contribution of different forms of plastic waste to total plastic waste generation around the world it only shows the data specific to the country selected and the bar plot also show the data related to that specific country alone.
